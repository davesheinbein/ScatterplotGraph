# Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph
--- 

This project visualizes the performance data of professional cyclists, specifically highlighting times and years with potential doping allegations. This scatterplot uses D3.js to create an interactive, dynamic data visualization where users can explore each data point for insights.

## Live Demo

You can view and interact with the project on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/dsDeveloper/pen/YzmQJXK).

## Features

- **Interactive Scatterplot**: Displays cyclist performance over the years with different colors representing categories (e.g., male and female).
- **Dynamic Tooltips**: On hover, each data point reveals additional information about the cyclist's time and year.
- **Legend**: Color-coded legend for easier identification of different data categories.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Hover effects and dot animations for a refined user experience.

## Technology Stack

- **D3.js**: For building the SVG elements and managing scales, axes, and tooltip functionality.
- **HTML/CSS**: Custom styles for background gradients, container layouts, dot styles, tooltips, and responsive adjustments.
- **JavaScript**: Data fetching, formatting, and D3 visualization logic.

## Files

- **index.html**: Defines the scatterplot container, tooltip, and references for D3.
- **styles.css**: Custom styling for background gradients, container layouts, dot styles, tooltips, and responsive adjustments.
- **script.babel**: Core JavaScript for data fetching, scaling, axis setup, and tooltip interactions.

## Installation
